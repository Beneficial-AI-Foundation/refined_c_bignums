Follow these steps exactly to prove a Coq lemma.

1. Replace `Admitted.` with `Show. Qed.`
2. Run a tool to see if the lemma verifies.
3. If the proof verifies, remove `Show` and run the tool again to check it verifies. Stop.
4. If you get "Attempt to save an incomplete proof", this shows that you have made progress. Go to step 6.
5. If you get some other error, your most recent line must have been incorrect. Remove it.
6. Add exactly one line, just before `Show`, with what you think is the correct next step.
   It is important that `Show` is always just before `Qed`, so you can see what the unsolved goal is.
   You may have to move `Show` inside `-`, `+`, `--`, etc, depending on how nested the first unsolved goal is.
7. Go to step 2.
