Follow these steps exactly to prove a Coq lemma.

1. Replace `Admitted.` with `Show. Qed.`
2. Run a tool to see if the lemma verifies.
3. If the proof verifies, remove `Show` and run the tool again to check it verifies. Stop.
4. If you get "Attempt to save an incomplete proof", this shows that you have made progress. Go to step 6.
5. If you get some other error, your most recent line must have been incorrect. Remove it.
6. Add exactly one line, just before `Show`, with what you think is the correct next step.
   It is important that `Show` is always just before `Qed`, so you can see what the unsolved goal is.
   You may have to move `Show` inside `-`, `+`, `--`, etc, depending on how nested the first unsolved goal is.
7. Go to step 2.


If you see:
```
Error: Expected a single focused goal but 0 goals are focused.
```
This means you have proved a subgoal under a bullet point and then tried to keep proving under that bullet point.

 1 Look carefully at the exact line number in the error message
 2 Examine the proof structure at that specific location
 3 Check if there are nested bullet points (like +) that have completed their subgoals
 4 Remove only the problematic bullet points or structure at that location
 5 Don't change unrelated parts of the proof or try to rewrite the entire proof

Focus on the minimal change needed to fix the specific issue at the exact location indicated by the
error.


If you only see this and no other information:
```
Error:
 (in proof carry_update_preserves_binary): Attempt to save an incomplete proof
(there are remaining open goals).
```
This means you need to add a bullet point to enter a new subgoal.


If you see an error like
```
Error: Hnlt is already used.
```
Delete the proof at this line and afterwards.
Then start working line-by-line using the procedure at the top of this document.
